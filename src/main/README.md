Chris Strong

Description: 
This project is a media database that allows users to add, edit, and delete media items.
The project is built using Java and JavaFX. The project is built using the MVC design pattern.The media items are stored in a database and can be accessed by the user.
The user can also search for media items by any of the values of a type of Media. 
The user can also sort the media items by title, rating, and release year. 
The user can also export the media items to a text file and collect information in a Json file.

Inspiration:
The inspiration for this project came my desire be able to organize a media collection, like netflix, spotify, or Imdb.
I wanted to be able to add, edit, and delete media items. I also wanted to be able to search for media items by any of the values of a type of Media.
I also wanted to be able to build something that would be able to work as the beginning of a large media database for a professional context.

Inspiration for the project came from the following websites:
Netflix - Netflix.com
Spotify - Spotify.com
Imdb - Imdb.com
Apple tv - Apple.com/tv

My personal inspiration came from my brother who is a software engineer at Sony Pictures Animation and I wanted to build
something functional that he may develop or use in his work. And no he did not help me with this project, but I hope that he
is proud of my project and coding progress.
